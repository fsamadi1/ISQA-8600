```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


``` {r}
newdata=read.csv("/Users/fsamadi@unomaha.edu/Desktop/ISQA 8600/HFS Service Data.csv")
summary (newdata)
library (ggplot2)
ggplot(data=newdata)+geom_point(mapping=aes(x=age, y=duration, color=age, size=duration))
```

This plot is not the best one, because it is not recommneded to use size for a discrete variable, in this case, duration. Also, the column duration is not neat and needs to be reorganized nicely in order to be more visible and readable. 

``` {r}
ggplot(data = newdata) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = program_name), color="pink")+facet_wrap(~program_name, nrow=2)
```

This plot is another example of a bad plot, because it is using an unnecessary color that is not really needed for the visualization of the plot.
It makes the plot appear unprofessional.
